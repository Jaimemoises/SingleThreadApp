This is a Java program that uses the merge sort algorithm to sort an array of data. The program has been specifically designed to optimize its performance by minimizing the number of passes the data makes from one array to another during the sorting process. This is because such passes can introduce delays in the execution of the code, which can slow down the program's performance.

To achieve this optimization, the program has been built to prioritize speed over memory usage. This means that it sacrifices some memory usage in exchange for a significant improvement in the speed of the sorting process. By doing so, the program is able to quickly sort large amounts of data, making it suitable for use in applications where performance is a critical factor.

Overall, this optimized Java program using the merge sort algorithm is designed to provide fast and efficient sorting of data, with a focus on minimizing delays and maximizing performance.
